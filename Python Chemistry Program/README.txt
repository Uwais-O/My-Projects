Created a program that dived into the world of chemical engineering. The Python Chemistry program allowed users to select a specific chemical equation and manipulate data with the equation. The program functioned as a calculator which implemented both file handling and many math modules such as numpy and matplot. 
The user was able to obatin various results from multiple elements and compounds through an easy to use menu. 
The program served to eliminate the need to physically workout equations or plot graphs from said equations. In essence the calculator did the heavy lifting for the user.
