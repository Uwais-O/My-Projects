Designed and implemented a task manager to assist with tracking of employees as well as tasks. The program utilized file handling to both store and present
data relating to specific tasks. Factors such as employee names, dates and document numbers were used as search criterias to find relevant tasks and update, 
change or remove them. File handling acted as a database for the task manager data.
